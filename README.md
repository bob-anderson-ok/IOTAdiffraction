This application (by Bob Anderson/IOTA) is a command line tool for creating fundamental plane 
diffraction images of one or two asteroids using the Sinc-diffraction method. It will apply the effect of a
finite diameter star and the spectral response of the observation camera. 

Input parameters are read from a JSON5 formatted file that is passed as a command line argument.

A version of this code was custom-tailored to create the OccultDiffraction application for Occult4.

This was done to allow continued development of IOTAdiffraction without inadvertently affecting Occult4.

OccultDiffraction is a derivative application used in Occult4. It is the result
of a collaborative effort between Bob Anderson and Dave Herald.
